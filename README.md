Seasons of code repository

I learned html,css in the first week and made a webpage for Mario which I attached code files in the week 1 folder.

In the second and third weeks I learned JavaScript and completed the task of making stopwatch I also committed the code files of stop watch which can be found in
  the stopwatch folder.
  
Later I learned and practiced the angular framework.
I made a Todo-list app with angular whose code files can be found in the cwh-todolist folder.

I also made a task-reminder app with angular for which created a seperate repository, the following is the link to it:
  https://github.com/PaneeshDV/SOC-Angular.git
  
In the last week I got familiarised with Django, but unfortunately I was not able to learn it completely and couldn't do the last task.
  I couldn't complete the last task to the required extent and I regret about it.
  
This learning experience felt great,
